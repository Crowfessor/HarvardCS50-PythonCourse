# Harvard CS50's Introduction to Programming with Python

This repository contains my solutions to Harvard's CS50P (CS50's Introduction to Programming with Python) problem sets. All solutions have passed check50 with 100% completion.

## ⚠️ Academic Integrity Notice

This repository is shared for **educational and reference purposes only**. 

### Important Guidelines:

- **DO NOT** directly copy and paste these solutions for your own submissions
- **DO NOT** use these solutions to bypass the learning process
- **DO** use them as a reference if you're stuck, but try solving problems on your own first
- **DO** compare your solutions with mine after completing the assignments yourself

### Why This Matters:

CS50 has a strict [Academic Honesty Policy](https://cs50.harvard.edu/python/2022/honesty/). Submitting someone else's work as your own violates this policy and defeats the purpose of taking the course. The real value comes from:

- Struggling with problems and finding solutions yourself
- Making mistakes and learning from them
- Building genuine problem-solving skills
- Understanding concepts deeply, not just copying working code
